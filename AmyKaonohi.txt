Aloha, my name is Amy. I was born here in Hawaii but I grew up in Oregon and Florida. I love to do makeup, bake, and dance. 

For my final project I am thinking about doing an app like Pinterest, where you have users that can share links to 
websites and store them in collections, and they can share photos of their own things as well.
